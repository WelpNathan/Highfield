This is home to the Highfield Qualification's Webcam Invigilation project made in collaboration with `Sheffield Hallam University` and `Highfield Qualifications`. It's a convenient way to invigilate candidates via the use of webcam and screen recording streams. It integrates with a simple AWS EC2 server using continuous delivery.

This repository hosts:
- Source code
- Nginx proxy configuration
- Linux systemd configuration
- Github action for continuous delivery
- Images including Highfield Qualification Logo's (all rights reserved)

## Quickstart
This application was made using `Visual Studio 2019` but we have found no issues running this in other programs such as `Rider`.

## Extra information
Technology used for project:
- [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
- [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/)
- [.NET 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
